Technically, temozolomide is an alkylating agent and can cause DNA damage by forming methyl radicals. However, the cell line has mutations in ATR, BRCA2, CSF1R, KDM5C, MLL, MUTYH, SMARCA4, TP53, which can affect its sensitivity to the drug. In particular, BRCA2 mutations can make cells more resistant to alkylating agents. CSF1R mutations can lead to resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma. KDM5C mutations can impair the DNA repair process, making cells more sensitive to DNA damage. MLL2 mutations can also impair the DNA repair process and make cells more sensitive to alkylating agents. MUTYH mutations can impair the base excision repair process, making cells more sensitive to alkylating agents. However, ASXL1 mutations can impair the DNA methylation process, which can affect the drug sensitivity.

Drug Sensitivity: ?[/INST]",Sensitive,"Sensitive. ABT-737 is a BCL-2 family protein that selectively inhibits BCL-XL, BCL-2, and BCL-1. BCL-2 family proteins play a key role in apoptosis regulation by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. Mutations in IRS2 and NBN may affect the drug sensitivity, but they do not confer resistance to ABT-737. In vitro studies have shown that ABT-737 can induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, including those with IRS2 and NBN mutations. However, more research is needed to fully understand the drug sensitivity in the context of these mutations.

However, the exact mechanism of action and the specific mutations in the cell line may influence the drug sensitivity. In this case, the cell line has mutations in ARFRP1, IRS2, NBN, and WHSC1L1. ARFRP1 mutations can lead to resistance to PI3K inhibitors, but IRS2 and NBN mutations have not been linked to PI3K inhibitor sensitivity. Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine the drug sensitivity in this specific context.

NPM1 mutations can lead to chromosomal instability and genomic rearrangements, which can contribute to resistance to EGFR inhibitors. TP53 mutations can lead to increased apoptosis, which can be detrimental to the survival of the cell line, but can also contribute to resistance to EGFR inhibitors. DOT1L mutations can lead to hypermethylation of the H3K36CpG site, which can result in the loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

Drug Sensitivity: ?[/INST]",Sensitive,"Resistant. PI-103 is an inhibitor of PI3K, DAPK3, CLK4, PIM3, HIPK2.

However, the cell line in question has mutations in ERBB4, NOTCH1, SPEN, WT1, which are not directly related to PI3K pathway genes. However, ERBB4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and NOTCH1 is a receptor that regulates gene expression, both of which can be involved in PI3K signaling. Additionally, SPEN mutations can lead to dysregulation of PI3K pathway genes through epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible that the cell line is resistant to PI-103 due to these mutations. However, more research would be needed to confirm this.

However, the specific mutations in the cell line are not mentioned for the drug A-443654. Therefore, the drug sensitivity for the cell line with given mutations is unknown for A-443654. For LIN31, the drug SMILES structure suggests that it is an IGF1R inhibitor, and the mutations in the cell line do not have known links to IGF1R signaling, making the drug sensitivity uncertain. However, the drug LIN31 has been reported to have therapeutic effects in KRAS-mutant cancers, and the cell line has a KRAS mutation, making it a reasonable assumption that the drug may be sensitive for this cell line. However, further research and experiments are needed to confirm this.

The mutations of the cell line are ASXL1, BCL6, CD274, DNMT3A, EGFR, EPHA3, FGFR4, GNAS, KDM6A, MLL2, MAP2K4, NBN, NOTCH1, PALB2, RAD54L, ROS1, SMARCA4, SPEN, TNFRSF14, TP53.
Drug Sensitivity: Resistant<</SYS>>Think step by step and decide in a single word reflecting the drug sensitivity of the drug on the cell line with given mutations: [Sensitive/Resistant], [Reasoning].
Drug and cell line mutations: 
The drug is AZ960. The drug SMILES structure is CC1=CC(=NN1)NC2=C(C=C(C(=N2)N[C@@H](C)C3=CC=C(C=C3)F)C#N)F. Drug target is JAK2, JAK3. Drug target pathway is Other, kinases.
The mutations of the cell line are ABL1, CDKN2A, FANCC, KRAS, RNF43, TP53.
Drug Sensitivity: ?[/INST]",Sensitive,"Resistant. AZ960 is an inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK3. However, the cell line has mutations in KRAS and RNF43, which are not commonly associated with sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Additionally, the cell line has mutations in FANCC and TP53, which may impact sensitivity to various drugs. Therefore, the drug sensitivity is likely resistant.","[1647, 1979, 88, 600, 1621]"
