      "Sensitive. The presence of mutations in the cell line does not necessarily mean that the drug will be resistant. The sensitivity or resistance of a drug to a particular cell line depends on various factors, including the specific mutations present, the drug's mechanism of action, and the expression level of the drug target in the cell line. In the given example, the drug MK-8776 targets CHEK1, CHEK2, and CDK2, which are involved in the cell cycle. The presence of mutations in ERBB4, GNAS, NOTCH1, SDHA, SPEN, and WT1 may affect the cell cycle, but it does not necessarily mean that the drug will be resistant.

The presence of mutations in the PI3K/MTOR signaling pathway, specifically in GNAS and NOTCH1, could potentially impact drug sensitivity. However, without further information on the specific nature and extent of these mutations, it is not possible to make a definitive call. Therefore, the answer is: Unknown.\n",

The presence of mutations in the EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 genes, which are the targets of AZD8931, suggests that the cell line may be resistant. However, the presence of mutations in other genes, such as ABL1 and RNF43, could also impact the drug sensitivity. Further analysis, such as functional assays or clinical trials, would be needed to definitively determine the drug sensitivity. Therefore, the answer is: Uncertain.\n",

The sensitivity of a drug to a specific cell line can depend on various factors, including the specific mutations present in the cell line and the expression levels of the drug target. In order to accurately determine drug sensitivity, additional experimental data, such as IC50 values or cell viability assays, would be required.\n",

      "To determine the drug sensitivity, we need to consider if any of the identified mutations in the cell line are known to confer resistance to ERK inhibitors. According to literature, mutations in KRAS and BRAF (not present in this cell line) are commonly associated with resistance to ERK inhibitors. However, mutations in ABL1, CDKN2A, FANCC, RNF43, and TP53 have not been consistently linked to resistance to ERK inhibitors.\n",

In some cases, the drug may still be effective in targeting the wild-type protein or pathway, even if the mutated protein is less sensitive or even resistant to the drug. In this example, SALUBRINAL is known to inhibit EIF2A, and the mutations in the cell line do not affect the EIF2A protein directly. Therefore, the drug is likely to be sensitive to the cell line.\n",
